# Welcome to my code castle, Traveler!

Welcome, brave Traveler! This is my code castle where I store my treasures.

**What kinds of treasure do I store here?**  
Of course it's a pure essence of enthusiasm and bugs. People often calls it *"pet projects"*  
I'd been developing them when I was young and very motivated. 

**What did happen with me?**  
Oh, brave traveler, I've got a job. Nowadays I'm developing projects not for fun. I'm doing it for people and companies.

*Keep going traveler, I hope you will find something useful here...*
